        /*
        Write a program to sort the array in ascending order using Insertion sort algorithm. After Sorting return the array.

        Note both the array and size is already given.

        Input:-

        [4,3,2,5,1]

        Output:-

        [1,2,3,4,5]
        
        1. The code creates an array called "arr" with the elements [4,3,2,5,1].
        
        2. It then assigns the variable "length" to the length of the array (5 in this case).
        
        3. A for loop is used to iterate over the array, starting at the second element (index 1)         and ending at the last element.
        
        4. On each iteration, a variable "current" is assigned the value of the current element in         the array.
        
        5. A second variable "j" is also declared and set to "i-1" (which is the index of the         previous element in the array).
        
        6. The while loop then begins. It will continue to execute as long as "j" is greater than or         equal to 0 and the element at index "j" in the array is greater than the "current" variable.
        
        7. Inside the while loop, the element at index "j+1" in the array is set to the value of the         element at index "j".
        
        8. "j" is then decremented by 1.
        
        9. Once the while loop completes, the element at index "j+1" in the array is set to the         value of the "current" variable.
        
        10. The for loop continues until all elements in the array have been evaluated.
        
        11. Finally, the sorted array is logged to the console.
