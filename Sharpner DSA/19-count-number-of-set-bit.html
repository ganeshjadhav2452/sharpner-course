             1. Takes an unsigned integer as an argument.

            2. Declares a variable `count` and initializes it to 0.

            3. Begins a while loop that continues as long as the integer is greater than 0.

            4. Inside the loop, performs a bitwise AND operation between the integer and 1.

            5. If the result of the operation is 1, increments the `count` variable by 1.

            6. Shifts the integer to the right by 1 place using a right shift operator.

            7. The loop continues until the integer becomes 0.

            8. Returns the `count` variable, which represents the number of '1' bits in the 
            original integer.

            var hammingWeight = function(n) {
    
                let count = 0;
              while (n > 0) {
                if (n & 1 === 1) {
                  count++;
                }
                n = n >> 1;
