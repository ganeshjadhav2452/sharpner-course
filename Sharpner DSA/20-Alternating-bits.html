        /*
        This code checks if the binary representation of n has alternating bits, which means that every bit is different from its neighbors (0 followed by 1, or 1 followed by 0).

        1. Initialize previousBit: previousBit is set to the least significant bit of n, which can be obtained by n & 1. The binary AND operation between n and 1 returns 1 if the least significant bit of n is 1, and 0 if it's 0.

        2. Shift n right by 1 bit: The line n = n >> 1 shifts n to the right by 1 bit. This operation effectively divides n         by 2 and discards the least significant bit.

        3. Enter the loop: The loop continues as long as n is greater than 0. This means that the loop will keep running         until n becomes 0.

        4. Initialize currentBit: The line let currentBit = n & 1 sets currentBit to the least significant bit of the new         value of n.

        5. Compare previousBit and currentBit: The line if (previousBit == currentBit) checks if the current and previous         bits are the same. If they are, the function returns false, because the bits are not alternating.

        6. Update previousBit and shift n right by 1: The line previousBit = currentBit sets previousBit to the current bit,         and the line n = n >> 1 shifts n to the right by 1, discarding the least significant bit.

        7. Repeat the loop: The code goes back to step 4 and repeats the loop until n becomes 0.

        8. Return true: When the loop finishes, the function returns true, indicating that all bits in n are alternating.
