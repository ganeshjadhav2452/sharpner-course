        You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

        Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

 

        Example 1:

        Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
        Output: 3
        */
        let jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb";
