        /*
        This code sorts an array of 32-bit integers based on the number of set bits (bits with a value of 1) in each integer. 

    1. Initialization: An empty array `arr1` is initialized to store the number of set bits     for each integer in `arr`. 

    2. Counting Set Bits: The code loops through each element in `arr` using a for loop with     the index `i`. For each element, another for loop with the index `j` counts the number of     set bits by checking if each bit is set (equals to 1) using a bitwise AND operation `&`     with `1 << j`. If a bit is set, the `count` variable is incremented. After the inner     loop, the value of `count` is added to `arr1`.

    3. Sorting: The code sorts both `arr1` and `arr` using a bubble sort algorithm. The order     is determined by the number of set bits, with elements having fewer set bits appearing     first. If two elements have the same number of set bits, then their corresponding     elements in `arr` are used as a tiebreaker, with smaller values appearing first. After     sorting, the code returns the sorted `arr`.

    Note: The sorting is not the most efficient method for sorting, and for larger arrays, a     more efficient algorithm like QuickSort or MergeSort would be preferable.

        

        let arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
        var sortByBits = function (arr) {
            let arr1 = []
            for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
                let count = 0;
                for (let j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
                    if (arr[i] & (1 << j)) {
                        count++
                    }
                }
                arr1.push(count)
            }
            for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length - 1; i++) {
                for (let j = 0; j < arr1.length - 1 - i; j++) {
            if (arr1[j] > arr1[j + 1] || arr1[j] == arr1[j + 1] && arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                        let temp = arr1[j]
                        arr1[j] = arr1[j + 1]
                        arr1[j + 1] = temp
                        temp = arr[j]
                        arr[j] = arr[j + 1]
                        arr[j + 1] = temp
                    }
                }
            } return arr

        /*
        This code is a JavaScript implementation of sorting an array of integers based on the number of set bits in their binary representation.

        The input array is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

        The function sortBySetBits takes an array of integers as input and sorts them based on         the number of set bits in their binary representation.

        The first step in the function is to define a helper function countSetBits which takes an         integer n as input and returns the number of set bits in the binary representation of n.         To do this, a variable count is initialized to 0 and is incremented every time a set bit         (represented by 1) is encountered in the binary representation of n. The binary         representation of n is obtained by shifting the bits to the right (using the >> operator)         and checking the least significant bit (using the & operator with 1). This process is         repeated until all bits have been processed.

        Next, the main sorting logic is implemented using two nested loops. The outer loop         iterates over the array using i as the index. The inner loop iterates over the array         again using j as the index. The inner loop starts from i + 1 so that each element is         compared only once and the sorting is done in-place.

        At each iteration, if the number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[i] is         greater than the number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[j], then the         elements are swapped. This process is repeated until the array is sorted in ascending         order based on the number of set bits in their binary representation.

        Here's a detailed breakdown of the sorting process:

        Outer loop iteration 1: i = 0

        Inner loop iteration 1: j = 1
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[0] (0) is 0 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[1] (1) is 1. Since 0 < 1, the elements are         not swapped.
        Inner loop iteration 2: j = 2
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[0] (0) is 0 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[2] (2) is 1. Since 0 < 1, the elements are         not swapped.
        Inner loop iteration 3: j = 3
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[0] (0) is 0 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[3] (3) is 2. Since 0 < 2, the elements are         not swapped.
        ...
        Inner loop iteration 8: j = 8
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[0] (0) is 0 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[8] (8) is 1. Since 0 < 1, the elements are         not swapped.
        Outer loop iteration 2: i = 1

        Inner loop iteration 1: j = 2
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[1] (1) is 1 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[2] (2) is 1. Since 1 = 1, the elements are         not swapped.
        Inner loop iteration 2

        Outer loop iteration 2: i = 1

        Inner loop iteration 1: j = 2
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[1] (1) is 1 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[2] (2) is 1. Since 1 = 1, the elements are         not swapped.
        Inner loop iteration 2: j = 3
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[1] (1) is 1 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[3] (3) is 2. Since 1 < 2, the elements are         not swapped.
        ...
        Inner loop iteration 8: j = 8
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[1] (1) is 1 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[8] (8) is 1. Since 1 = 1, the elements are         not swapped.
        
        Outer loop iteration 3: i = 2
        
        Inner loop iteration 1: j = 3
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[2] (2) is 1 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[3] (3) is 2. Since 1 < 2, the elements are         not swapped.
        ...
        Inner loop iteration 8: j = 8
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[2] (2) is 1 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[8] (8) is 1. Since 1 < 1, the elements are         not swapped.
        
        Outer loop iteration 4: i = 3
        
        Inner loop iteration 1: j = 4
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[3] (3) is 2 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[4] (4) is 1. Since 2 > 1, the elements are         swapped.
        ...
        Inner loop iteration 8: j = 8
        The number of set bits in the binary representation of arr[3] (3) is 2 and the number of         set bits in the binary representation of arr[8] (8) is 1. Since 2 > 1, the elements are         not swapped.
        
        Outer loop iteration 5 to 8 will work similarly and the result will be [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7].
