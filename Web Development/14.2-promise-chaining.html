        Task details

      We need to understand the use of resolve and reject.



      The Love story:-



Imagine you make a promise to your girlfriend that you will buy her a watch on her Birthday.

She says that she will go on a date with you after she gets the watch.

      But if he breaks the promise => she say that "she will breakup with him"



      2 days before her birthday

Since you have made a promise for her birthday, you will not resolve it before her birthday.

So girlfriend has a pending promise and you also don't have a date.



1 day before her birthday

The girlfriend is still waiting for the promise to resolve. She is very excited



On her birthday.

2 things can happen.



You resolve the promise with the watch -> resolve(watch) -> .then((watch) => seeing the watch your girlfriend take you on the best date)



      You reject the promise with some excuse(Error situation) -> reject('Error: Out of budget')      -> .catch((errormessage) => she looks at the errormessage and she breaks up with him)



      So folks its super important to handle both -> rejection as well as resolve





      Deliverable 

      Look at the code which is provided



      This is the sequence in which it should be executed. Check the last 5 lines

      After breakup the boy logs ino facebook.
      He calls create2ndpost to create post2
      After creating2ndpost , the user wants to deletes the 2nd post and print it.
      After creating3rdpost , the user wants to deletes the 3rd post and print it.
      Now he goes mad and he deletes all the posts and prints each one of them, till nothing       remains.


      We want to print all the post which we have deleted in the  sequence in which they got       deleted.



      OUTPUT

      POST2

      POST3

      POST1

      You are only allowed to touch the last 5 lines.

      Do not touch any other function!!!
